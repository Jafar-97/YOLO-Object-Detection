# YOLO Object Detection Notebook

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates object detection using the YOLOv5 model. It utilizes a pre-trained model from ultralytics to identify and classify objects within images. This notebook is perfect for understanding the capabilities of YOLOv5 in real-world image recognition tasks.

## Features
- Uses the YOLOv5s model for object detection.
- Demonstrates detection on static images.
- Visualizes detection results directly within the notebook.

## Dependencies
- PyTorch: A deep learning framework that provides flexibility and speed.
- OpenCV: For image processing tasks.
- Matplotlib: For plotting images in the notebook.
- Ultralytics YOLOv5: Pre-trained models for object detection.

## Installation
To set up your environment to run this notebook:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jafar-97/YOLO-Object-Detection.git
   cd YOLO-Object-Detection
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install torch matplotlib numpy opencv-python-headless ultralytics
   ```

3. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
Execute the notebook cells to perform object detection on the included sample images as well as images from external URLs. The results will display bounding boxes around detected objects along with their classifications.
